First approach to Python using a Fernet key and an external library to make this possible, we made it so that when a user logs in, they will see their file containing their personal passwords in clear text. If this is not the case, the file is not decrypted and therefore it is not possible to access its contents. 
Of course, if it appears logged in, after exiting the app, the files would still be encrypted.
